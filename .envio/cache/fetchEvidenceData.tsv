This indicates that we should not ask whether there are at least five real interactions but that we should reject applications with more than half fake interactions.\\n\\nThis becomes even more evident when we look at the structure of the document. The rule against fake interactions is part of the section beginning with \\"and should not be:\\" which lists other criteria that lead to rejections such as pornography, stolen ideas or poor encoding. These are criteria regarding the *quality* of the submission. A submission that is made up almost entirely by bot interactions seems unprofessional and suspicious. In no way can such a post be regarded as a positive story to be told. Consequently, it is a poor quality submission and should be rejected."}

Currently, there is no existing entry for this address on this blockchain in the registry.\\n\\nOn balance, the information provided for this token submission correlates with the independently sourced data. The main point of concern regarding this submission is the lack of specific information about the function or purpose of this contract.\\n\\nBased on the current standards of the registry guidelines, it's critical that the tokens our users interact with are carefully vetted and proven to have solid functional presence in the ecosystem. In this case, the lack of specific information about the contract function leaves room for potential security or financial risks. \\n\\nGiven this, it is INCONCLUSIVE whether this token should be accepted onto the registry. Without clear understanding of what this contract specifically does, it remains ambiguous. We need to ensure that our registry only includes token contracts that we have absolute confidence in. \\n\\nPlease provide additional comments and thoughts for further discussion."}

The Public Note is defined as \\"a short mandatory comment field used to add a comment or information about the contract that could not fit in the public name tag.\\"\\n\\n\\nThe submission must be rejected because the Public Note \\"HYPERAI Smart Contract\\" does not provide any additional information about the contract that could not fit in the Public Name Tag \\"HyperAI Token\\". The Public Note field is a mandatory requirement and must be used to add a comment or information that clarifies or expands on the Public Name Tag, not simply restate it using different words. None of the examples given in the policy document indicate that this submission is considered acceptable. This Public Note is incredibly lazy and ironically provides less information than the Public Name Tag, since it only replaces the word 'Token' with the broad and redundant term 'Smart Contract'.\\n\\n\\nThe submitter will likely argue that submissions with similar Public Notes have already been accepted into this list; and while it's true that previous submissions have been accepted (*unchallenged*) with similar issues in the Public Note field, my intention is that this case will serve as an important precedent moving forward. Rejecting this submission will help get the registry back on track with its original intention of providing useful information in the Public Note field.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, upholding the policy guidelines is critical to maintaining the quality and usefulness of this registry. Allowing redundant or useless Public Notes undermines the purpose of the Public Note field.

I understand the concern raised regarding the use of the subgraph ID instead of the deployment ID. However, I’d like to draw attention to the following policy statement:\\n\\n\\"Issues with the code that do not affect the correctness of the results returned for the specific Chain ID in the submission in question are acceptable and must not lead to the rejection of a submission.\\"\\n\\nIn the case of Chain ID 534352, the use of the subgraph ID or deployment ID yields identical results. Both options return the same accurate data, ensuring the correctness of the module’s output is not affected in any way. Given this, I respectfully argue that this issue should not impact the validity of the submission.\\n\\nThat said, I have updated the repository to use the deployment ID in order to align with the policy and avoid potential future challenges. This update is made out of respect for the rules, not as an admission that the previous method was wrong, as the correctness of the results was never compromised.\\n\\nI believe that the underlying functionality of the module meets the core objective of the policy—to deliver accurate and consistent results—regardless of the ID used. With this in mind, I kindly request that the jurors consider voting \\"YES,\\" as the module performs correctly and the update ensures future compliance without affecting the outcome.\\n\\nThank you for your understanding and thoughtful consideration."}
